&lt;p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, I proposed through the groups that permeate me like &lt;a href="https://coolab.org">coolab&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://portalsemporteiras.github.io">PSP&lt;/a>, prototyping a bamboo tower construction as a specific contribution to a more inclusive and locally developed Community Network infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Libremesh</title><link>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/libremesh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/libremesh/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="libremesh">Libremesh&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the realm of open-source community networks, LibreMesh stands out as an essential tool for building autonomous and decentralized network infrastructures. Recently, the LibreMesh community made an exciting announcement, revealing the release of new versions aligned with the latest updates from OpenWrt. This development marks a crucial step in keeping pace with the rapid evolution of the network hardware market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The significance of this update cannot be underestimated, especially in an environment where new hardware versions are constantly being introduced. Older versions of OpenWrt, on which LibreMesh was previously based, may not provide support for the latest devices. Consequently, updating LibreMesh becomes essential to ensure compatibility with the most recent hardware, enabling communities to make the most of emerging technologies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lokal</title><link>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/lokal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/lokal/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="lokal">Lokal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I played a crucial role in the Lokal project, focusing on the installation and configuration of Libremesh on the routers to establish a robust mesh network. This setup was essential for ensuring the seamless operation of Lokal within a mesh network environment.

Together, at Coolab, we create inspiring and impactful educational materials, promoting knowledge and awareness in various areas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rede Comunitária PSP</title><link>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/psp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/psp/</guid><description>&lt;p>PSP is a civil society association that manages and maintains a community telecommunication infrastructure in the Souzas neighborhood, Monteiro Lobato - São Paulo, Brazil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the &lt;a href="https://coolab.org">coolab collective&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> most vital experience in funding and maintaining all the technical needs of a community network.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project proposes the development of an innovative framework for creating social technology aimed at low-income communities and/or family farmers preferably associated with community networks. The main objective is to design a technological matrix that includes a form of low-power analog communication between sensors. This communication will be enabled through the use of sustainable energy technologies, such as thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and water-activated paper batteries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inclusion of these communities in community network ecosystems is essential, as these networks provide a collaborative environment and knowledge exchange, allowing communities to access groups involved in the connectivity process in their territories. This integration strengthens community participation in the development and implementation of the proposed technological solutions, ensuring that they truly meet their needs and local contexts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sitio Do Astronauta</title><link>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/sitiodoastronauta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/sitiodoastronauta/</guid><description>&lt;p>As the creator of &lt;a href="http://sitiodoastronauta.com.br">Sítio do Astronauta&lt;/a>, a collective of artists, activists, and researchers working with free and community technologies, I bring my academic experience in science and my learning in reverse engineering as a hacktivist. Realizing the gap between academia and society, I decided to create this collective to communicate and bring science and technology to communities in a different way.
Sítio do Astronauta was conceived not only from my vision of exploring the frontiers of technology and art but also with the essential collaboration of &lt;a href="http://guerradimarcela.net.br">Marcela Guerra&lt;/a>. Together, we created a space where innovation and creativity come together to generate unique experiences. With a strong foundation in free and community technologies, the collective is dedicated to developing playful electronic activities that not only entertain but also educate.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
