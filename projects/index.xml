      <description>Lokal I played a crucial role in the Lokal project, focusing on the installation and configuration of Libremesh on the routers to establish a robust mesh network. This setup was essential for ensuring the seamless operation of Lokal within a mesh network environment. For detailed technical insights into this aspect of the project, please refer to this link.</description>

      <title>Projeto de Pesquisa: Comunicação de Baixa Potência para Tecnologia Social</title>
      <link>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/researchsocialtech/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://hiurequeiroz.github.io/projects/researchsocialtech/</guid>
      <description>Esboço da pesquisa Este projeto propõe o desenvolvimento de um framework inovador para a criação de tecnologia social direcionada a comunidades de baixa renda e/ou agricultores familiares de preferencia associados a redes comunitárias. O objetivo principal é conceber uma matriz tecnológica que inclua uma forma de comunicação analógica de baixo consumo energético entre sensores. Essa comunicação será viabilizada através da utilização de tecnologias de energia sustentável, como os geradores termoelétricos (TEG) e baterias de papel ativadas por água.</description>

      <description>As the creator of Sítio do Astronauta, a collective of artists, activists, and researchers working with free and community technologies, I bring my academic experience in science and my learning in reverse engineering as a hacktivist. Realizing the gap between academia and society, I decided to create this collective to communicate and bring science and technology to communities in a different way. Sítio do Astronauta was conceived not only from my vision of exploring the frontiers of technology and art but also with the essential collaboration of Marcela Guerra.</description>
